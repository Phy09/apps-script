## apps-script

#### Goals: 

These are some of the Google Apps Scripts I made to fix **real life** problems -- integrating technology to help issues in management for old-fasioned chinese businesses.

It is important to create a product that is intuitive and useful, **but most importantly, non-invasive** to the existing workflow. In the same way that it's hard to teach computers to grandma, it's impractical to introduce new systems if they do not get adopted.

Thus, the goal is to create simple-to-use scripts that either save a lot of time, or prevent easy-to-make mistakes.

#### Projects:

For this goal, I have three projects:
* **save-to-drive**: Automatically download bills received via email and save them to organised folders.
* **monthly-transaction-downloader**: Organise and download transactions on monthly basis; and find likely-duplicate rows in the data for inspection.  
* **monthly-employee-timetable**: Automatically create the timetables for employees, rotating their schedules.
